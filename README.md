# 👋 Hey, I’m Saksham

- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - Writing code that works (on the 10th attempt).
  - Debugging (a.k.a. staring at my screen until I find the typo).
  - Coffee (because it’s basically code fuel).
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - How to fix the bug I created while fixing another bug.
  - The magical art of “It works on my machine.”

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Projects that don’t involve 3 AM deployments.
  - Anything that won’t break the production environment… again.
  
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - If it’s urgent, reboot your computer. If it’s still urgent, email me. If it’s *really* urgent, send coffee.
  
- 😄 Pronouns: Code/Compile/Ship

- ⚡ Fun fact: I once fixed a bug by adding a comment. Still no idea how that worked.
